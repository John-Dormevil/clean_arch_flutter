A bunch of minimal brick to implement clean architecture principles in flutter.
Based on riverpod and go_router dependency

create a `mason.config.json` as follows

```json
{
  "projectName": "my_awesome_project"
}

```
### :bricks: clean_arch_screen

To create a new screen run from your root project dir
`mason make clean_arch_screen --name my-custom-feature -o ./lib/src/features/`
