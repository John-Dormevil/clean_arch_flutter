# clean_arch_screen

[![Powered by Mason](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fmason-badge)](https://github.com/felangel/mason)

This brick tries to follow clean architecture principles. 
The goal is to help create boilerplate code 
for **presentation layer** mainly the screen part.

Given a feature named user the brick will generate the `user_screen.dart` part

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ core
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ i18n
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ features
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ domain
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ presentation
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ screens
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user_screen.dart
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ user.dart
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ order
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
...
```
NB: The screens will have the following dependencies: `riverpod` and `go_router`
Riverpod is use for state management and go_router for routing.
